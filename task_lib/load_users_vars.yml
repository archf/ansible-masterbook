# accounts_profile var should be define either by parametizing the role or
# by defining a variable in the play wich will apply to multiple roles.

# This could be replaced by writing explicitly in the play book
  # vars_files:
  #   - /vars/external_vars.yml

  - name: load external vars_files (use accounts in defaults.yml by default)
  include_vars: "{{ USERS_DIR }}/defaults.yml"
  when: accounts_profile is not defined

- name: load external vars_files (override accounts in defaults.yml)
  include_vars: "{{ USERS_DIR }}/{{ accounts_profile }}"
  when: accounts_profile is defined
